Have base 2 numerical coding.#
$The main reason why a "telephone" operator like Skype is able to provide a telephone service at very low prices:
*It is due to the fact that the phone calls travel on the IP network (for example ADSL), the costs of which they are already paid by the user when he enters into a "?at" contract and therefore the packages vowels travel virtually "free" for most of their journey
It is due to the fact that it has made interconnection agreements with the Telecom Providers that they pay Skype a fee based on the percentage of traffic generated
It is mainly due to the advertising that is offered with the service.
It is due to having only long distance IP infrastructure, leaving the access infrastructure (much more expensive due to the high capillarity) to third parties, with the consequence of greatly reducing costs.#
$What is a feature of the Session Initialization Protocol (SIP)?
*It is possible to use a server to register a User Agent, so that the server know the mapping between the username and its current IP address.
It is necessary that the media stream is established with the help of server called Media relay.
It is not scalable, because it does not specify how to find users in different domain than the caller.
It is necessary that User Agent is always associated to the same IP address#
$Having to carry VoIP traffic with "toll-quality" guarantees :
*You need to create your own IP network and give priority to voice traffic.
It is possible to use the Internet, Skype proves that this approach works definitely good.
You need to create your own IP network and give priority to voice traffic.
It is necessary to create a dedicated IP network, in which there is no data traffic.#
$Using the coin-operated bucket (or laundry bucket) algorithm of capacity B token e filling speed r token / s can be controlled:
*The number of packets per second entered does not exceed r , and the maximum burst does not exceed B.
That the crossing time does not exceed rB seconds.
The number of packets per second entered does not exceed B , and the maximum burst does not exceed r .

You can be notified of the appearance of the desired user, only if he reconnects from one of the IP addresses known to the SIP domain.( MORE INFORMATION : through the Media Server, containing the voice mail boxes that actfrom answering machines, you can leave a message even if the recipient client it is not connected to the internet. He will receive the message as soon as he reconnects)#

$What is the reason of diffusion of VoIP among domestic users?
*The reduced cost associated to the possibility of VoIP technologies to compress voice channels, which require much less bandwidth the analog telephony, with a big reduction of bandwidth used in the backbone.
The reduced costs caused by higher costs in maintaining an high quality channel (the twisted pair) that is more expensive that physical lines used for data transmission.
Costs are often comparable with traditional telephony, but it is not necessary to pay an extra fee for each phone call, in addition to the ?at rate tariff of the ADSL line.
